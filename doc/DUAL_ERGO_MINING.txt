Team Red Miner Dual Coin ERGO Mining
====================================

2022-12-22 Initial version

Overview
--------
To mine using autolykos2+kaspa (which is the only supported dual
algo), take a working TRM autolykos2 command line and add a KAS
section in the middle or at the end:

--kas -o stratum+tcp://pool.woolypooly.com:3112 -u <kaspa wallet>.<worker> -p x --kas_end

If you don't want to dual mine on all devices, you can add a device
selection argument inside the --kas .. --kas_end clause. If you only
want to dual mine on gpu 0 and gpu 3 you would use:

--kas -d 0,3 -o stratum+tcp://pool.woolypooly.com:3112 -u <kaspa wallet>.<worker> -p x --kas_end

The dual mining setup for autolykos2 lets the user split the capacity
between autolykos2 and the second algo using the --dual_intensity
argument (please see the separate section below).

Power draw in dual mining will often be HIGH, especially on Vegas and
Polaris gpus. It depends on what clocks you're coming from. Use core
clock adjustments and the argument --dual_intensity (see --help or
USAGE.txt) to keep power draw in check.

Last, see the dual mining section in USAGE.txt or the miner's --help
output for additional arguments.


Dual Intensity Tuning
---------------------
For autolykos2 dual mining, you can balance the primary and dual algo
using the --dual_intensity argument:

- The argument range is 0.0-1.0. Zero means full autolykos2 mining, 1.0
  means full dual algo.

- If you don't specify the --dual_intensity argument, the dual
  auto-tuner will scan the range and choose a sensible value per
  gpu. You can observe the tuning results in the rightmost column in
  the miner stats output.

- You can enumerate values per gpu with a comma-separated list, e.g.
  --dual_intensity=0.4,0.4,0.7,0.7

- If the list is shorter than the number of gpus, the first value is
  used for the remainder of the gpus. This implies that a single value
  passed with --dual_intensity=0.3 will be used for all gpus.

- The argument can be placed anywhere on the command line, it does not
  need to be inside the --kas .. --kas_end range.

- It is _not_ recommended to use extreme values close to zero or one,
  for such setups it's better to simply mine a single algo instead.

- Dual intensity values will typically end up in the 0.25-0.75 range.

- If you want to control the dual auto-tuner behavior, TRM provides
  the --dual_tuner_weights=X:Y:Z argument. This argument is described
  in detail in USAGE.txt and the miner's --help output.
