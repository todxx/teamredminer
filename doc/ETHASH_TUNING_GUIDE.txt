TeamRedMiner Ethash Tuning Guide
================================

History:
v1.0 2020-01-16 (v0.8.0)

General Overview
================
In general, TeamRedMiner behaves similarly to other AMD ethash miners. The key
difference is our additional mining modes (B/C-modes) that use additional vram
on the gpus for additional beneficial effects. The specific effects are
different per gpu type and are described below in the separate sections.

If you have a tuned configuration for another miner, it should generally work
well although might not be the absolute optimum for your rig(s), especially if
you run in B or C-mode with TRM. The main exception is for cards driving
monitors or doing other simultaneous work. For those, you often need to specify
a lower manual --eth_config value or the miner will collide with rendering
tasks, having the driver reset the GPU during mining.

For more help, and for issues not mentioned in this document, please join the
TRM discord and ping us there.


Windows General Instructions
============================
For optimal results, and being able to use B/C-modes, you need to use an AMD
Adrenalin or Windows WHQL driver that supports large single buffer
allocations. The first such driver was Adrenalin 20.9.1. Without large
allocation support, you will only be able to run in A-mode using dual buffers,
which also adds a small additional power draw, and not use any of the more
advanced execution modes available in TRM.

Our testing was made with the Windows WHQL driver 27.20.1034.6, i.e. the driver
installed automatically on a Win10 with up-to-date feature updates in Jan 2021
when it detects AMD gpus in the system. The main reason we used this driver is
that it supports large allocations and (the standard tool) OverdriveNTool works
for setting clocks/voltages for Navi gpus. Many AMD Adrenalin drivers don't
interact well with OverdriveNTool, making it difficult to set up startup .bat
files settings clocks/voltages.

Host ram requirements is 4GB. However, due to how Windows handles gpu vram
allocations, you should make sure you have at least 8GB per gpu available as
virtual memory, set as a custom static size with min equals max.


Linux General Instructions
==========================
To be able to fully use all features in TRM, specifically the B/C-modes, you
need to use a driver that supports large single buffer allocations. This means
amdgpu-pro 20.30-20.40 or any ROCm >= 3.0. Without large allocation support, you
will only be able to run in A-mode using dual buffers, which also adds a small
additional power draw, and not use any of the more advanced execution modes
available in TRM.

Our testing was made on ROCm 3.3, ROCm 4.0, amdgpu-pro 20.30 and amdgpu-pro
20.40.

Host ram requirements is minimum 4GB, but we have heard about some systems
needing an upgrade to 8GB when using B/C-modes across many gpus. At the time of
writing, we don't know exactly why and when this is needed, but if you
experience instant hard crashes when allocating large amounts of vram on all
gpus and have an extra ram stick lying around, try increasing host ram on the
rig in question.


ETH Configuration
=================
In TRM, each gpu in the rig runs with an "ethash config", either decided
automatically by the miner at startup or passed by the user using the
--eth_config argument. You can read more about the format of this argument in
USAGE.txt, also bundled with the miner package and available on github.  The
configuration consists of a letter and a number, e.g. A288 or C524. The letter
denotes the mode, and the number the intensity. Unless specified, the miner will
auto-tune the intensity for you during the first few minutes of execution.

The first time you run TRM you should let the miner auto-tune the
intensity. There generally isn't any upside from a performance perspective
specifying the intensity manually, but for gpus running displays, or gpus
becoming too hot, you might want to tune it down to lower the hashrate. The
tuning can sometimes also shift between TRM versions, so it's not a bad idea
letting it run the auto-tuning process every time you run the miner.

If you do want to specify the config yourself to guarantee you're always running
with the exact same settings (never bad from a stability perspective), you can
check the chosen configs in the rightmost column in the 30 sec stats output by
the miner. They will always vary randomly from run to run and across multiple
gpus of the same type, it's fully normal. Enumerate all the eth configs there in
an --eth_config argument for the miner, and you'll bypass the auto-tuning
process in subsequent runs.


A/B/C-mode Mining
=================
The mining modes available in TRM differs between gpu types and are described in
each separate section below. They differ both in what they do and how they
can/should be used. Two things are always true though: the A-mode is a regular
mining mode similar to all other AMD ethash miners out there, and the B/C-modes
require much more vram, often as much as possible.

NOTE: using B/C-mode means that the multiple DAG cache (--eth_dag_cache),
typically used for ZIL+ETH switching, is not available.


High Sample Tuning Mode
=======================
When testing different tunings for ethash, assessing if you've crossed the
boundary where your gpu is unstable and produces bad hash calculations (called
"hw errs" in TRM) is imperative. TRM has a special argument for this named
--high_sample_mode, currently not mentioned in the --help section since it isn't
supported for all algos.

When testing new tuning, we suggest that you always run TRM with the added
argument --high_sample_mode=8. This will lower the internal difficulty 256x,
meaning each gpu will produce 256x more shares. The cpu verification then checks
if each share is valid and if it also matches the pool's difficulty. If the
latter, the share is sent to the pool.

This way, you can assess the nr of hw errs on a gpu 256x faster than when
running in normal mining mode, but you also don't run in a simulation mode,
you're earning exactly as much as during normal mining.

When done tuning you can opt to keep this argument, but it will consume extra
CPU power for verifying the extra shares and it generally confuses any API
consumers (mining distros and other 3rd party programs). Therefore, we
recommend removing it.


Polaris Cards (470-580)
=======================
There are a multitude of tuning guides, straps, ref boost guides etc available
for Polaris GPUs already, so we won't cover them in great detail here.

Polaris Stock-to-Performance Guide
----------------------------------
TRM does not currently support injecting straps automatically. We rely on the
users setting up good straps with bios flashes or manual tuning with
amdmemtweak. The following is therefore necessary to get a Polaris gpu going at
good ethash speed. There are many other guides out there expanding on each step
involved, but this should get you started:

NOTE: flashing a bios always presents an added risk. The guide here is presented
      as-is using known standard tools that have been used on millions of rigs
      worldwide, and even the few times when a bios flash goes wrong you can
      most often recover by reflashing the original bios in recovery mode / safe
      mode.

1)  Download atiflash (or amdvbflash) for your operating system. ATI WinFlash
    probably also works fine.
    
2)  List your adapters using "atiflash -i" and find the gpu you want to mod.

3)  Save your current bios using "atiflash -s N original.rom" assuming your gpu
    is adapter nr N.
    
4)  Copy your bios to a windows machine. Download a tool like e.g. SRB Polaris
    Bios Editor from https://github.com/doktor83/SRBPolaris
    
5)  Either google around for straps to use for your memory type (visible in the
    bios after you open the editor) or try the built-in "Pimp My Straps" feature
    (usally good enough for a first mod). Do any other modifications you'd like
    to include in the bios (clocks/voltages).
    
6)  Save the bios as "modded.rom" and flash it back to your gpu with "atiflash
    -p N modded.rom". Reboot.
    
7)  Set up a tool for controlling clocks/voltages. On Windows we recommend
    OverdriveNTool, on Linux either using a mining distro or reading up on how
    sysfs works (this assumes a certain degree of tech savviness).
    
8)  Set initial clocks to 1200 MHz core clk, 1900 MHz mem clk, 900mV. These
    settings are both generous and conservative.
    
9)  Start the miner and verify mining runs ok for a few mins. Then, start
    tweaking the clocks, going through:

    a) Increase the mem clk as much as possible while remaining stable.
    b) Lower the core clk as much as possible without losing too much hashrate.
    c) Lower the voltage as much as possible without crashing.

10) If you see a 8-10 MH/s hashrate and you're on Windows, make sure compute
    mode is enabled properly. Run the miner once with your normal arguments but
    by adding --enable_compute as well or use the bundled
    enable_compute.bat. Reboot after the miner exits.

11) You'd usually end up with something like 1150 MHz core clk, 2100 MHz mem
    clk, 850mV when done tuning. This is highly depending on your specific gpu,
    mem type and straps though.

12) For a last boost of 1-1.3 MH/s of hashrate, download the amdmemtweak tool
    and apply a "ref boost", running it as root or administrator increasing the
    refresh rate timing. You can usually increase it to 20-30 with "amdmemtweak
    -i N --ref 20", where N is your gpu adapter number like in the bios flash
    earlier. The TRM discord has a pinned .zip package in the ethash channel
    containing the files needed for windows and an example .bat file.

Polaris Mining Modes
--------------------
TRM provides A-mode and B-mode for Polaris cards. The A-mode is pretty much the
same mode as all other AMD ethash miners run, although optimized as much as
we've been able to. Compared to other miners, it generally shows as a slightly
lower power draw while keeping the hashrate high.

We also provide a B-mode for Polaris, using as much vram as possible on the
gpu. This mode doesn't have as big of an impact as for other gpu types, it
usually adds 0.2-0.5% of hashrate.

The default choice for Polaris is always A-mode, using a single DAG buffer if
the driver supports it, otherwise dual buffers. Dual buffers adds a slight power
draw penalty due to additional instructions.

To enable B-mode, you can either pass --eth_aggr_mode to enable it as the
default choice for all Polaris gpus in the rig, or you can pass a custom
--eth_config specifying the mode for gpu(s) to start with B.

The mode intensity range is the same for A and B, namely 12 * NrCUs:

470/570:    0-384
480/580:    0-432

Any higher specified number than this will be lowered to the max possible value.


Vega10 Cards (Vega 56, Vega 64)
===============================
With the 0.8.0 release, we have pushed our Vega kernel with a range of new
optimizations which most often translates into a small hashrate boost and a
power save of 3-4W per gpu compared to earlier versions. With the new B-mode,
it's also possible to shave off a few more watts, but it is not as stable with
advanced custom timing mods.

Note: the timing guides provided below are the same as the ones in our previous
ethash tuning guide. There are even better mods out there, especially for
Samsung mem gpus (typically Vega 64s and Vega 56 reference cards).  Many mining
distros also include highly competitive Vega tunings out-of-the-box that can
reach 52-53 MH/s for Samsungs.

Vega 56 Hynix Stock-to-Performance Guide (A-mode)
-------------------------------------------------
The Vega 56 GPUs with Hynix HBM2 memory are generally known to be
underperforming their Samsung siblings. With TRM, they can often reach 50 MH/s.

The tuning setup we have come to like in our tests is the following:

1) Start with your core clk at 1100 MHz while pushing the mem clock to 950
   MHz. If you know that your mem can't handle 950 MHz, lower it from the
   start. Use 875mV for voltage.

1) Start with the following modded mem timings as a baseline:

   --cl 18 --ras 23 --rcdrd 23 --rcdwr 11 --rc 34 --rp 13
   --rrds 3 --rrdl 4 --rtp 6 --faw 12 --cwl 7 --wtrs 4 --wtrl 4
   --wr 11  --rfc 164 --REF 17000

2) The guess is that this setup will hit 46-46.5 MH/s for you. The key to
   improving performance is --rcdrd. Proceed to lower that value one step at the
   time, stopping and restarting the miner between each change. You must be on
   the lookout for hw errors which means you've reached your GPU's limit.

3) If you're part of the lucky crowd and your GPU can handle a rcdrd value as
   low as 15-16, you should now be seeing a 50-50.2 MH/s hashrate. If your card
   starts producing hw errors, you need to increase rcdrd until you're
   stable. NOTE: you must _blast_ your fans to make sure the HBM temp is kept in
   check. You should always monitor the gpu mem temp as displayed by TRM in the
   stats output. You can also use the TRM built-in fan control to target a
   specific mem temp, see USAGE.txt for info on how to use --fan_control.

4) Lower the core clk as much as possible without losing hashrate. If you ended
   up ith a rcdrd value > 16, there should be room to lower it from 1100
   MHz. For a 50 MH/s hashrate, you probably need the 1100 MHz core clk to
   sustain it.

5) Lower voltage to 850/840/830/820 mV, as low as possible while
   remaining stable.

6) For better efficency (but lower hashrate), tune down your core clk
   and try to further lower the voltage.

7) See the separate part for B-mode below for a potential additional power save.

Using this setup, we have been running Gigabyte Vega 56 Hynix cards for > 50
MH/s with no hw errors. 

Vega 64 Samsung Stock-to-Performance Guide (A-mode)
---------------------------------------------------
The hardcore Vega 64 Samsung setup these days is to flash it with a
corresponding Vega 56 bios and apply advanced timings and powerplay table
mods. This lowers the HBM2 (mem) voltage to 1.25V and therefore the power draw
while still being able to run a high mem clock and produce a nice 50+ MH/s
hashrate, sometimes as much as 53-54 MH/s. We do not provide such an example
below, but recommend googling around for it or visit our Discord for more
info. For a hassle-free setup, you should check out mining distros specialized
on Vega tuning such as MMP OS and RaveOS.

If you're still on a Vega 64 bios, try the following for a 50-51 MH/s setup:

1) Set clocks to core clk 1075 MHz, mem clk 1107 MHz, voltage at 850 mV. Your
   card may need to clock down the mem clk to 1050-1080 MHz to be stable with no
   hw errs.

2) Use the following modded timings:

   --CL 20 --RAS 30 --RCDRD 14 --RCDWR 12 --RC 44 --RP 14 --RRDS 3
   --RRDL 6 --RTP 5 --FAW 12 --CWL 8 --WTRS 4 --WTRL 9 --WR 14
   --REF 17000 --RFC 249

3) Hopefully it runs stable and you should observe a hashrate around 50.5-50.9
   MH/s. If your GPU can't handle the timings, you need to relax them to less
   aggressive variants available in the AMD mem tweak thread on Bitcointalk, or
   come join the TRM discord for further suggestions.

4) For better efficiency (but lower hashrate), tune down your core clk and try
   to further lower voltage while remaining stable.

5) We reiterate: _blast_ your fans and monitor your mem temp as shown by the
   miner. Check USAGE.txt for our built-in --fan_control argument and how to
   target fans for a specific mem temp.

Vega 56 Samsung flashed 64 bios Stock-to-Performance Guide (A-mode)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
From a tuning perspective, we treated these cards like regular Vega 64
GPUs. You might need to increase core clk somewhat compared to true
Vega 64s to compensate for the fewer compute units, otherwise follow
the guide for Vega 64 Samsung.

In general, the flashed cards couldn't handle a maxed out mem clk at
1107 MHz, rather needed to clock down to 1060-1075 MHz. Start stable,
and add a step where you slowly increase the mem clk again.

Vega 56 Samsung (56 bios) Stock-to-Performance Guide (A-mode)
-------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to run these gpus at very high hashrates by loosening straps
enough to run a higher mem clk, but we have not created and tested such timings
ourselves and would only be presenting work done by others by including them at
the time of writing. Therefore, we only present an example that reaches 49-50 MH/s
on a V56 Samsung ref:

1) Set your core clk significantly to 1000 MHz, mem clk to 940 MHz. We ran our
   tests in power states core P3+mem P3. Start with 850 mV for voltage.

2) Apply the following timing modifications:

   --RAS 26 --RCDRD 12 --RC 38 --RRDS 3 --RRDL 4 --REF 21000

3) Start mining, you should hit 49-50 MH/s.

4) Lower voltage as much as possible. We ended up at 825 mV.

Vega 56/64 B-mode Mining (after tuning for A-mode)
--------------------------------------------------
TRM provides A-mode, B-mode and C-mode for Vegas. The C-mode is intended for
Radeon VIIs and will never really have a benefit over B-mode on Vega10.

For Vega 56/64, the A-mode is already very capable of delivering high hashrates
at an efficient power draw. However, the B-mode creates a slight shift in core
vs mem clock ratio necessary to sustain a specific hashrate. It will use all
available vram on the gpu. Early reports show that at many custom timing mods,
the B-mode is slightly harder to keep stable over time.

The default mode for Vegas is A-mode. To enable B-mode, you must specify a
manual --eth_config with each Vega config starting with B. The --eth_aggr_mode
does NOT currently apply for Vegas.

If you have tuned your Vegas for A-mode and then switch to B-mode, you should be
able to lower your core clk 30-80 MHz for the same hashrate. It may vary
slightly. The goal is efficiency: by lowering the core clk we're aiming to
shave off an additional ~2W per gpu. You may also be able to lower voltage
slightly after you've lowered the core clk.

The mode intensity range for Vegas is 12 * NrCUs:

Vega 56:    0-672
Vega 64:    0-768

Any higher specified number than this will be lowered to the max possible value.


Radeon VII (Vega20)
===================
As of TRM version 0.8.0 there are now significant improvements for VII hashrates
allowing VIIs to easily achieve over 100Mh/s.  The best of these hashrates can
currently only be achieved on Linux and require modifying some of the default
kernel parameters for amdgpu drivers.  For more details read below.

Vega20 Mining Modes
-------------------
A-mode - The most basic mode using the least memory, but achieving the lowest
         hashrate.  This mode will typically produce about ~82Mh/s at 1600MHz
         cclk.  This mode has no special requirements and should work on all
         operating systems and drivers.

B-mode - This mode uses more memory in order to increase performance for the
         VIIs.  This mode will typically produce about ~87Mh/s at 1600MHz cclk.
         This is the default recommended mode for Windows or unmodified Linux.
         This mode requires that the driver version supports large allocations
         (allocations more than 4GB).

C-mode - This mode uses even more memory and produces the best hashrates for
         VIIs.  This mode typically produces about ~99Mh/s at 1600MHz cclk with
         modified memory timings.  Unfortunately this mode will only work
         correctly on Linux with modified kernel boot parameters for the amdgpu
         kernel module and the miner running with root permissions, as well as
         using a driver version that supports large allocations.

IMPORTANT: We have seen some VIIs getting close to zero boost between A and B
modes. The B mode should see a significant hashrate increase. Many times those
GPUs have been running the very original bios (v105) and need to flash to v106
that was released by AMD shortly after the Radeon VII release date. That bios
can be tricky to find at this point. Please ping us in the TRM discord and we
can provide it.

Radeon VII Tuning for Windows and Stock Linux (B-mode)
------------------------------------------------------
If you are running Windows or a Linux distro on which you do not want to modify
kernel parameters or do not want to run the miner as root, you will need to run
VIIs in B-mode for best performance.  The miner will automatically select this
mode for your VIIs when started. For the B-mode to work properly, your drivers
will need to support large allocations.

Typical tuning for VIIs with Hynix memory running in B mode:

NOTE: These tunings are ones that we've found to be relatively stable in our
      tests.  However we can't guarantee that they will work on all cards.

1) Before starting to tune, we suggest blasting your fans to max while you work
   on dialing in clocks and voltages.  Always keep an eye on your core and
   memory temperatures while tuning.  Try to keep TEdge and TMem under 70C.

2) Start with core clk at 1600MHz and drop memory clk to 900MHz.

3) Apply the following timing changes to the memory:

   --ref 7500 --rtp 6 --rrds 3 --faw 12 --ras 19 --rc 30 --rcdrd 11 --rp 11

   WARNING: If you are tuning memory clock, these timings can become unstable
            over 1000MHz memory clock.

4) You should now be able to hit 87-88Mh/s.  Check that you are not getting any
   hw errors in the miner, which would indicate that the above timings are too
   aggressive for the memory. Use the described --high_sample_mode=8 argument to
   quickly assess your hw err ratio.

5) At this point you can start tuning your voltage lower.  We typically see that
   the VIIs need around 881mV core voltage at 1600MHz core clk, but this will
   vary depending on asic quality and temperatures.

6) Once you have dialed in your core voltage, try lowering fans until you
   achieve a stable, safe temperature.

While the tune above is generally a good place to start, users will likely want
to tune their cards up/down to achieve their ideal running tune.  If you are
increasing memory clock, keep in mind that the above timings will likely become
unstable above 1000MHz memory clock.  For going above 1000MHz memory clock, we
suggest using the following timings:

--rtp 6 --ref 7500 --rcdrd 13 --rp 13 --rrds 3 --faw 12 --ras 25 --rc 38

We have seen cards run at over 1200MHz memory clock and be stable with these
timings.

Radeon VII Tuning for Linux with Custom Kernel Parameters (C-mode)
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running Linux and are able to modify the kernel boot parameters and
run the miner with root permissions, your VIIs will be able to fully utilize the
performance boost of C-mode.  If the miner sees that the above conditions have
been met, it will automatically select C-mode for your VIIs.

1) Setting up Kernel Params

   The following linux kernel boot parameters need to be added to your grub
   config:

   amdgpu.vm_block_size=10 amdgpu.vm_size=1024
    
   On ubuntu based linux distributions this can be done by adding the parameters
   to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in /etc/default/grub and then running
   'update-grub2'.  After making these changes you will need to reboot the
   system for the changes to take effect.  After rebooting you can verify that
   the changes took effect by looking at the output of the following command:

   dmesg | grep "drm.*block size"

   If the changes were successfully applied, you will see 'block size is 10-bit'
   in the output.  Please note that adding these parameters can sometimes result
   in slightly reduced hashrates on non-VII cards.

2) Running the miner

   Next make sure you are running the miner as root. How to do this will vary
   depending on how the users's distro is setup to run miners, but for testing
   purposes you can either log into the system as root or use the 'sudo'
   command.  If you successfully apply the kernel param changes and run the
   miner as root you should see a message like the following print in the miner
   after it starts initializing the GPUs:

   [2021-01-16 17:04:51] GPU 0 Radeon VII boost applied.

   After this you should see the miner automatically select mode C for your
   VIIs.

3) Tuning for VIIs with Hynix memory running in C mode:

   Here we will provide two sets of sample tunings: typical and aggressive.  The
   aggressive tune will push up hashrate at the expense of increased power
   usage.  We suggest users make sure that their VIIs are well cooled
   (preferably liquid) for testing the aggressive tune.

   NOTE: These tunings are ones that we've found to be relatively stable in our
         tests.  However we can't guarantee that they will work on all cards.

   Typical Tune (for Hynix memory):
   Core Clock:     1600MHz
   Core Voltage:   900mV
   Memory Clock:   1000MHz
   Timings:        --ref 7500 --rtp 6 --rrds 3 --faw 12 --ras 19 
                   --rc 30 --rcdrd 11 --rp 11
   
   Aggressive Tune (for Hynix memory):
   Core Clock:     1800MHz
   Core Voltage:   993mV
   Memory Clock:   1150MHz
   Timings:        --rtp 6 --ref 7500 --rcdrd 13 --rp 13 --rrds 3
                   --faw 12 --ras 25 --rc 38
                   
   WARNING: The aggressive tune will typically overheat stock air cooled cards!

   a) Before starting to tune, we suggest blasting your fans to max while you
      work on dialing in clocks and voltages.  Always keep an eye on your core
      and memory temperatures while tuning.  Try to keep TEdge and TMem under
      70C.

   b) Start with setting your core and memory clocks to the tune settings above.

   c) Apply the core voltage from the tune settings above.

   d) Apply the timing changes to the memory.

      WARNING: The 'typical' timings above can become unstable over 1000MHz
               memory clock.

   e) You should now be able to hit 99-100Mh/s on the typical tune and around
      111-112Mh/s on the aggressive tune.  Check that you are not getting any hw
      errors in the miner, which would indicate that either the core voltage is
      too low or the memory timings are too aggressive for the memory. Again,
      use --high_sample_mode=8 to quickly measure the ratio of hw errs.

   f) At this point you can start tuning your core voltage lower.  We typically
      see that the VIIs need around 881mV at 1600MHz core clk and 968mV for
      1800MHz core clk, but this will vary depending on asic quality and
      temperatures.

   g) Once you have dialed in your core voltage, try lowering fans until you
      achieve a stable, safe temperature.

These two suggested tunings will probably not be ideal for all users.  For
further tuning we suggest starting from one of the above tunings and then
lowering core clock and voltage to achieve the prefered performance and power
level, and then lowering memory clock until a loss of hashrate can be seen.


Navi10 (5700XT/5700/5600XT)
==========================
TRM v0.8.0 both contains a range of optimizations for the standard A-mode kernel
as well as a new default mining mode for Navi10, the B-mode.  Compared to
previous versions the A-mode has reduced power draw and often a slight hashrate
improvement as well. A first version of this improved kernel was released in
v0.7.22. It has since been modified in v0.8.0 to be more similar to < 0.7.22
versions while still preserving the power draw improvements and hashrate
increase.

Navi10 A/B-mode
---------------
The B-mode is the biggest news for Navi10 in the v0.8.0 release, at least for
5700XT/5700. It has been deemed stable enough in tests to become the new default
mining mode for 5700XT/5700. You must have a driver that allows large
allocations, otherwise the miner will downgrade to A-mode. The A-mode is a
standard ethash mining mode, similar to other miners.

The B-mode runs at a much lower balance between core clk vs mem clk, meaning for
5700XT/5700s you can typically drop core clk -100 MHz and core voltage -50mV
while still preserving even a high hashrate such as 55-56 MH/s, only losing
-0.02-0.05 MH/s while saving 5-6W, sometimes even more. On 5600XT, there
isn't enough vram available with the 6GB to produce the large effect seen on the
bigger 5700XT/5700s, although the effect is still there.

Given the above, TRM chooses B-mode as default for 5700XT/5700s since it's
straightforward to realize the benefits for these larger gpus. For 5600XTs,
TRM chooses the standard A-mode by default. Advanced tuners should be able to
manually use the B-mode on 5600XTs with --eth_config=B, then carefully clocking
down their core clock step by step, finally lowering voltage 6.25-12.5mV or
so. This will save power, but the effect is smaller than for 5700s.

The mode intensity range for Navis is 16 * NrCUs:

5700XT:        0-640
5700/5600XT:   0-576

Any higher specified number than this will be lowered to the max possible value.


5700/5700XT Stock-to-Performance Guide
--------------------------------------
Most 5700/5700XTs can be flashed easily. Igor's lab has created a range of tools
for advanced Navi tweaking. This is a guide for taking a stock Navi 5700/5700XT
to a setup that produces 56 MH/s in the new TRM B-mode. Note that not all gpus
can handle the high hashrate and will crash repeatedly. Such gpus need to be
clocked down and run at a less aggressive hashrate.

For using the guide below, we highly recommend making sure you can run the TRM
B-mode by using a driver that supports large single allocations (amdgpu-pro >=
20.30 on linux, Adrenalin >= 20.9.1 on windows).

NOTE: flashing a bios always presents an added risk. The guide here is presented
      as-is using known standard tools that have been used on many rigs
      worldwide, and even the few times when a bios flash goes wrong you can
      most often recover by reflashing the original bios in recovery mode / safe
      mode.

1) Set up a tool to control clocks and voltages. You can use the AMD driver
   tools, MSI Afterburner or OverdriveNTool on Windows. On linux you need to
   read up on and understand how the sysfs api works for amdgpu-pro, or use a
   mining distro that helps you setting clocks.

2) Start with a safe configuration of 1275 MHz core, 875 MHz mem (1750 MHz for
   drivers displaying 2x mem clock), set 850mV for voltage. Start the miner and
   verify that mining works fine.

3) Google "Igor's lab red bios editor". Read the tutorial they provide and
   download and install the software.

4) Save the bios from your gpu to disk using atiflash or amdvbflash (and keep it
   to be able to flash back if necessary).

5) Open the saved bios in RedBiosEditor, copying the saved bios from linux to a
   win workstation if necessary. There are often two memory types available in
   the bios, Samsung and Micron. If you're not 100% sure which type you have, do
   the copy-up described below for both.

6) Bios mod 1: strap copy-up. We want to copy the strap (the long string of
   letters and digits) for 1500 or 1550 MHz to the higher frequency
   entries. Copy it and paste it for all higher entries above the strap you
   copied. Save the bios and flash to the gpu. Reboot and test mining again. You
   should now hit approx 53 MH/s.

7) Bios mod 2: reopen your (already edited once) bios. Open the trap timings
   editor for the 1500/1550 MHz entry that you copied in the previous step by
   clicking the "1550 MHz" button. You want to increase the DRAMTiming 12 (tREF)
   entry to 2x the original value. Do the same thing to the higher frequency
   entries, or copy/paste the 1550 MHz strap again after you've modified
   it. Remember to do this for both mem types unless you know you have Micron or
   Samsung. You can get even higher hashrates by using 3x the original tREF
   value, but we suggest 2x as a first test. Save the bios, flash to the
   gpu. Reboot.

8) When running the miner again, you should hopefully see a higher hashrate yet
   again. if you have a driver that supports large allocations and TRM defaults
   to B-mode, a core clock of 1250 MHz and mem clock at 912 MHz should now
   produce a 55.5-56.0 MH/s hashrate. If you're in A-mode, you need a core clk
   around 1350-1400 MHz to support such high hashrates.

9) Now, retune your gpu to the configuration of your choice. Start by tuning the
   mem clk to a level where your gpu seems to run stable and produces the
   hashrate you're looking for. Less can definitely be more if you're looking
   for efficiency. Next, tune down the core clk as much as possible, restarting
   the miner to check if you've lost hashrate or not. We want to find the
   balance between core clk and mem clk so that neither of them is the clear
   bottleneck. In B-mode, you usually see a sharp drop in hashrate when the core
   clk is dropped -25 MHz too low. In A-mode, you will also see the hashrate
   dropping but not as dramatic.

   Last, lower the voltage step by step as much as possible. Gpus with good
   cooling can often drop as low as 700-725mV. For dropping below 700mV, the
   powerplay table limits need to be modified. This is not covered by this
   quickstart guide.

   Note: Micron memory is in general easier to tune for these high
   hashrates. Samsung GDDR6 is often harder to run stable, and often needs to be
   clocked down to target e.g. 54-55 MH/s or lower.

5600XT Stock-to-Performance Guide
---------------------------------
The 5600XTs differ from their larger 5700 cousins with a lower mem bandwidth and
6GB of vram instead of 8GB. As mentioned above, this means that the TRM B-mode
cannot boost the performance at a given (lower) core clk for 5600XTs as much as
for 5700s. The effect is much smaller, and the range where a lower core clk
means A-mode loses hashrate but B-mode preserves it is much tighter. Therefore,
we assume A-mode is used for 5600XTs below.

1) Bios flashing on many 5600XTs is a real hassle. There are additional locks
   and security mechanisms in place in most stock bioses. The typical approach
   is to find an unlocked bios that can be flashed onto your gpu, then modify it
   and reflash it. Sometimes it needs to be manually edited before flashing as
   well, changing the identifier to match your target gpu. Forums like the Red
   Panda Mining discord (#bios-mods channel) is one type of place where you can
   find both unlocked and already-modded bioses to flash. Make sure you save
   your original bios for recovery/safe mode restore flashing if things don't
   work out!

2) If you managed to find a bios to work with, the process is the same as for
   5700XT/5700s in the guide above and won't be repeated here. You might also
   have found an already modded bios that runs great, meaning you don't have to
   modify it yourself.

3) The rest of the process for working through core clk/mem clk/voltage is also
   identical to the proposed process for 5700XT/5700s, although you will rather
   end up with a 41-42 MH/s hashrate than 55-56 MH/s.


Happy mining!
