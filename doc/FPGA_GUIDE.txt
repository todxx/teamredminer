TeamRedMiner FPGA Guide
=======================

History:
v1.2 2022-06-06 Added section for Osprey E300.
v1.1 2022-01-21 Added voltage control and U50C/ECU50 sections.
v1.0 2021-12-12 Initial version.

General Overview
================
From version v0.9.1 TeamRedMiner(TRM) has support to mine ethash on three FPGA
products based on Xilinx FPGAs: the Xilinx Varium C1100, SQRL Forest Kitten 33
and Xilinc U50C including clones like the ECU50.  Mining with FPGAs is only
officially supported on Linux, however Windows users can also mine using a Linux
VM with USB passthru for the FPGA USB JTAG connections.

In v0.9.1, additional telemetry was added as well as voltage control integrated
into the miner for C1100 and U50C.  FK33 voltages can still only be controlled
through the SQRL bridge.  Voltage control through TRM also requires flashing a
custom firmware provided by TRM.  Descriptions of the flash procedure, voltage
control arguments, and tuning examples are included below in separate sections.
Adding voltage control is highly recommended since the stock vccint voltage is
higher than needed and lowering vccint is an easy way to save 7-10W of power
per card.

Due to limited voltage regulator capacity for the HBM2 memory parts of the fpga
on FK33 (20A) and U50C (24A), TRM limits the allowed overclocking range on both
these cards to what we believe are sensible max values that produce good
performance while still minimizing the risk of damaging the hardware.  The C1100
does not suffer from this problem.  However, on request we added a safety
override mechanism in v0.9.1 for users that still want to push the hardware
more.  See the --fpga_allow_unsafe argument in USAGE.txt for more info.  Please
note that we recommend having excellent overall cooling before doing
extended runs at unsafe clock levels.

Mining Instructions
===================
TRM currently only communicates to FPGAs via the USB JTAG ports available on the
boards.  Ensure that your FPGA boards' USB JTAG ports are connected to the host
system where TRM will be running.  Verify that TRM can detect the attached
devices by running 'sudo ./teamredminer --list_devices' and checking that the
devices you expect show up in the output.  Next you will need to prepare the
required command line arguments for TRM such as the algorithm selection, your
mining pool's address, your pool username/wallet address and password, then use
these to construct the command to start TRM.  For example:

sudo ./teamredminer -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x02197021fefa795fec661a45f60e47a6f6605281.trmtest -p x

These are the minimum command arguments needed to start TRM mining with FPGAs.
The first time TRM is run it will download the necessary bitstreams for the FPGA
boards being run and save them in the 'bits' local directory.  Running this
command will start TRM and begin mining on all available FPGAs (and AMD GPUs)
using the default clock and voltage settings for each FPGA (there are different
default settings for each card model).  TRM can be limited to run on specific
FPGA devices using the --fpga_devices option using device index or DNA strings
(see --help or USAGE.txt for details).

The default clocks and voltages can be fairly conservative for some boards,
such as the C1100. Most users will likely want to adjust these default values 
by using the --fpga_clk_core and --fpga_clk_mem options.  Additionally TRM has
temperature monitoring for the FPGA core temperature and the memory temperature
and will throttle mining speeds to maintain temperatures within the set limits.
By default the limits are both set to 90C, but they can be adjusted using the
--fpga_tcore_limit and --fpga_tmem_limit options.  When running on a system
with GPUs and FPGAs, the --hardware option can be used to select if TRM is to
run only GPUs or only FPGAs.

A typical command for starting TRM may look like:
sudo ./teamredminer -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x02197021fefa795fec661a45f60e47a6f6605281.trmtest_f -p x --fpga_clk_core=505 --fpga_clk_mem=1000 --fpga_tmem_limit=70 --log_file

When choosing core and memory clocks, it is best to stay close to a 1:2 ratio
between the core and memory clock frequencies.  This is where the TRM FPGA
design is best balanced and achieves optimal results.

TRM discord and ping us there.


TRM Custom Firmware Flashing
============================
To enable voltage control on U50C and C1100, custom firmware for the board
satellite controller (SC) needs to be flashed first.  All necessary support is
integrated in the miner.  Run the miner with --fpga_update_fw added as an
argument, and it will download and flash on all devices that either runs a
non-TRM firmware or a TRM firmware with a lower internal version number.

To test flashing on a single device, you would typically use:

sudo ./teamredminer -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x02197021fefa795fec661a45f60e47a6f6605281.trmtest_f -p x --hardware=fpga --fpga_update_fw --fpga_devices=0 

If that works ok, shut down the miner, then flash all devices by removing the
last argument and run again. Quit when all devices have been flashed and run
your normal start script.

NOTE 1: just like for a motherboard or gpu, flashing a firmware/bios always
means taking a small risk.  If there's a power outage, usb cable glitch, or
other similar event happening during the flash the process will fail and your
board will most likely fail to power up.  It is not bricked, but needs to be
reset by reprogramming the SC over the JTAG debug header (we can safely say that
this has been thoroughly verified by TRM devs during development).  This should
be possible with any jtag adapter supported by openocd but takes some knowledge
and potentially building your own cable.  We will be able to provide some
support around this, and if it would happen too frequently we can write a HOWTO
guide.

NOTE 2: if you're using e.g. a C1100 and switching between mining with TRM and
working in the Alveo XRT environment, the TRM firmware _should_ be fully
compatible, but if that isn't the case or you need to downflash for other
reasons, you can force a reflash with the XRT tools. For a C1100 on pci bus id
03:00.0 you would run:

sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt program -d 0000:03:00.0 --base --force


Voltage Tuning
==============
With a flashed custom TRM firmware, the U50C and C1100 can use the integrated
voltage control in the miner.  FK33s still need to use the SQRL Bridge.  The
tuning process is similar regardless of which tool sets the voltages.  That
said, FK33s don't have much room to navigate due the limited HBM2 power rail,
and should run at the suggested lowest possible voltages unless you have decided
to override the safety limits and test a higher config.

To control voltages using TRM, you use two or three arguments. The U50C does not
support changing the mem voltage and should only use the vccint and vccbram
arguments. Example:

--fpga_vcc_int=x,y,z,...
--fpga_vcc_bram=x,y,z,...
--fpga_vcc_mem=x,y,z,...

where x,y,z,... is the voltages in mV in device order.  See USAGE.txt or the
miner --help output for more details.  If you have a mixed rig with different
types of fpgas you can skip devices with empty strings.  Assuming your order is
one FK33, one ECU50 and one C1100, you would use e.g.:

--fpga_vcc_int=,750,750 --fpga_vcc_bram=,850,850 --fpga_vcc_mem=,,1200

Fpga devices in TRM are by default sorted in DNA order and then enumerated
0,1,2,... The main point is to get a static device order across reboots without
depending on a specific usb bus id order.  Voltage arguments follow the
enumerated device order.  However, if a device is added or removed, this can
skew an existing configuration.  To make life easier when adding a new device,
you can use the --fpga_devices=DNA1,DNA2,... support added in v0.9.1 to create
your own enumeration, then add the new device DNA at the end to guarantee that
existing voltage arguments will still be mapped correctly to the already tuned
boards, then adding the voltages for the new device at the end of each voltage
argument.

For tuning voltages and handling crashes, this is the process we've followed:

1) For stock voltages, the normal case is that vccint 850mV is much too high,
   vccbram 850mV ok but on the low side, and vccmem 1200mV is ok.

2) We start with a generous config, slightly depending on what hashrate you're
   targeting:

   60-65 MH/s: vccint 750mV, vccbram 850mV, vccmem 1200mV
   65-70 MH/s: vccint 800mV, vccbram 865mV, vccmem 1200mV
   70-75 MH/s: vccint 850mV, vccbram 875mV, vccmem 1200mV
   75-   MH/s: vccint 850mV, vccbram 885mV, vccmem 1230mV

3) Repeatedly run the miner, establishing a threshold for when you deem a
   certain config stable, it could be 30 mins, 2h, 24h.  In general, if there's
   an immediate restart due to errors coming right after the initial DAG build,
   the same config might still run ok for days, and you might want to discard
   such restarts when declaring if a tuning is good or not.  Instead, focus on
   repeated crashes or error rates creeping up after having mined successfully
   for a while.  

4) The first step is to lower vccint as much as possible.  This is where we save
   the most power compared to a stock config.  The initial tunings above are
   quite generous, so the first step down can be -25mV or so.  After that, use
   -10mV increments, +5mV back up when you start to experience crashes and/or
   repeated high error rates. Most U50C can run as low as 700mV for 69.1 MH/s,
   and C1100s at 76.9-77.4 MH/s often end up in the 740-760mV range.  There are
   always unlucky silicon samples that need significantly more voltage though,
   and it does depend on cooling as well.

5) C1100: when vccint is stable, do the same thing with vccmem, lowering it 5 or
   10mV at the time.  At some point you will most likely see error rates
   creeping up.  It's up to you if you want a strict 0.00% error rate displayed
   in the miner stats, or if you think 0.01-0.05% errors are ok.  It's important
   to remember that when balancing right at the edge of stability temperatures
   do come into play in a different way.  A small error rate of 0.02% can easily
   grow into more if ambient temps would increase slightly.  Our recommendation
   is therefore to at least increase vccmem a bit from the level where you
   start seeing errors, preferably to a point where you see no errors at all.
   That said, we have C1100s that run at 0.10% errors in a wide vccmem voltage
   range and doesn't seem very sensitive to ambient temps, and the applied
   tuning is still a winning trade.  You will have to test your cards to find
   out.

6) Last, lower vccbram. For TRM ethash mining, the vccbram rail does not use
   much power and the power save upside isn't very significant.  However, you
   can still try to lower vccbram in steps of -5mV for an optimal tuning.
   Starving vccbram often leads to hard crashes.

7) Handling crashes: the main point of the process above is to always know what
   was changed in a stable config and therefore easily reset back in case of
   issues appearing.  TRM also generally recovers the fpga from any type of
   crash and automatically resumes mining, so in very rare crash events it might
   even be the best trade-off to keep the more aggressive tuning.  However, when
   pushing for hashrates close to 80 MH/s or even above, it might be difficult
   to even find a baseline config.  A few pointers about crash types:

   Hard crash: hashrate drops to 0.00 h/s. Most often vccbram being too low.

   Low core utilization restarts: could be multiple things, try increasing
                                  vccbram, then vccint.

   Core crash: hashrate increases and shows a bogus high hashrate, often with an
               increasing err rate.  Vccint is likely too low.

   High error rate: try increasing vccmem, vccbram, vccint in order.  For very
                    pushed configs above 80 MH/s, there's a limit where nothing
                    will help.


Tuning Xilinx Varium C1100
==========================
The Xilinx Varium C1100 is a very well designed card from the perspective of
power delivery, but it can be a challenge to adequately cool due to its single
slot passive cooling design.  Typical mining rig cooling will not suffice for
this card and additional cooling must be provided to the card.  High static
pressure server chassis can some times achieve good results, but the most
reliable solution is to directly attach a blower (such as the SanAce B97's) to
the back of the card.  Many users have found that the best way to do this is via
a 3d-printed mounting bracket, however many users have had success with low-tech
methods such as ample usage of tape.

IMPORTANT: The C1100 must be powered through both the PCIe slot and the AUX
power connector.  Not connecting both PCIe slot and AUX power can result in
board components overheating.  While the on-board power delivery is well
designed, it draws 12V current from both the PCIe edge and AUX connectors and
requires both to handle higher power loads.

Assuming the C1100 is adequately cooled and with the additional of voltage
adjustments, most cards will run stably at 630MHz core clk and 1255MHz memory
clock.  Cards with exceedingily good cooling or very good silicon quality may be
able to reach up to 670MHz core and 1330MHz memory clock frequencies.  If you
experience crashes trying to reach higher clock levels, read the voltage tuning
section for more input.

This is a sample set of 7 x C1100 running at 630 MHz / 1255 MHz with voltages
tuned down, given an example of the spread between lucky and unlucky silicon:

Tuning SQRL Forest Kitten 33
============================
Most FK33s come with an active heatsink that keeps the cards well cooled during
typical operation.  Unfortunately, the power delivery circuitry on the card is
somewhat lacking when it comes to running designs using large amounts of HBM
memory bandwidth, such as TRM ethash.  Due to the VCCHBM reglator on the card
only being rated for 20A of output current, TRM implements a 1000MHz limit for
the memory clock frequency on this card.  Due to the 1000MHz memory clock limit,
we recommend that users run a core clock of 510MHz to maximize performance while
minimizing power usage.  With the addition of --fpga_allow_unsafe in v0.9.1 it
is possible to run FKs at higher clock speeds, but this is at the user's own
risk.

While TRM does not currently support adjusting voltages on the FK33, it is
possible to adjust voltages on the card prior to starting TRM using external
tools such as the SQRL bridge.  Due to the lower memory and core clock
frequencies required by the undersized vcchbm regulator, we recommend that users
lower their board voltages as low as they are capable of going on the FK33
boards: 0.777V for vccint, 0.821V for vccbram, and 1.164V for vcchbm.  These
settings will save power and help keep the vcchbm regulator cool (and reduce the
potential for damage to the regulator).

IMPORTANT: While the 1000MHz memory clock limit will prevent most boards from
damaging their vcchbm regulators, it is important to keep the vcchbm voltage low
to minimize current on the rail.  Running at 1000MHz memory clock with a high
vcchbm voltage can result in current high enough to damage the regulator.


Tuning Xilinx U50C or ECU50
===========================
Similar to the SQRL FK33, the U50C and ECU50 also suffer from a limited vcchbm
power rail.  They are rated for 24A, and TRM therefore limits them to 1125 MHz
mem clk unless the safety override argument --fpga_allow_unsafe has been
used. For our tests, we have only had ECU50 boards with good cooling
capabilities, meaning the results might not be directly applicable to U50C
devices.

The cards generally run very well at 570 MHz core, 1125 MHz mem for 69.14 MH/s.
With TRM's added voltage tuning, they can often undervolt to vccint 700mV and
vccbram 800mV for 75W of board power from the input sensors.  This also keeps
the devices right at the max of the standard PCIe slot power rating.
Unfortunately, controlling the vccmem voltage is not possible on U50C/ECU50
devices.


Tuning TUL TH53/TH55
===========================
The TUL TH53/TH55 cards have a well designed thermal solution that is more than
capable of keeping the cards cool for running ethash at even the highest
clocks.  Unfortunately the power delivery for the HBM was originally designed
for 24A, and TRM therefore limits the memclk to 1125MHz unless the safety 
override argument --fpga_allow_unsafe has been used.  (We are working with TUL
to validate how much additional current the HBM rail can safely supply given
the very well designed thermal solution on the board.  Once verified with TUL,
we will raise the safety limit.)

The cards generally run very well at 575 MHz core, 1125 MHz mem for 69.14 MH/s.
While the cards are capable of adjusting vccint, TRM does not yet support
voltage tuning for the TH53/TH55. Unfortunately controlling the vccmem voltage
is not possible on TH53/TH55 devices, and the default vcchbm is 1.40V.


Tuning Osprey E300
===========================
The Osprey E300 cards have a well designed thermal solution as well as power
delivery.  The limiting factor in ethash performance on these cards tends to
be silicon quality, as these boards use a lower speed grade silicon than most
other FPGA boards (they use -2 grade instead of -2LV grade).  This lower speed
grade results in parts that have a much wider range in quality.  We have seen
some parts that will easily run 650MHz/1300MHz core/mem clks, while others
have struggled to run above 575MHz/1150Mhz core/mem clks.  We suggest that
each card be individually tuned to determine it's optimal performance.

Note that support for the E300s requires running TRM locally on the Zynq
control board and requires adding the option --fpga_e300 to enable hardware
support for the E300 Zynq jtag interfaces.  Here is an example of how to start
TRM on the E300 Zynq (make sure to use the linux-armhf TRM release):

./teamredminer -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x02197021fefa795fec661a45f60e47a6f6605281.trmtest -p x --fpga_e300

Currently TRM does not have support for controlling voltages on the E300s, and
voltages will need to be controlled via the Osprey firmware webui.
