  -h, --help                Display this help message and exit.
      --debug               Enables debug log output.
      --disable_colors      Disables console output colors.
      --force_colors        Forces console color output even if the terminal does not seem to support them.
      --api_listen=IP:PORT  Enables the api. IP:PORT is optional. If present, the IP:PORT combo decides
                              the interface(s) and port to listen to. Default is 127.0.0.1:4028. For
                              external access, use e.g. 0.0.0.0:4028. It's also valid to only specify the
                              port, e.g. 4029.
      --log_file(=FILENAME) Enables logging of miner output into the file specified by FILENAME.  If no filename
                              is provided, the miner will log to trm_<algo>_<yyyymmdd_hhmmss>.log in the current
                              working directory.  If the log file already exists, the miner will append.
  -l, --log_interval=SEC    Set the time interval in seconds for averaging and printing GPU hashrates.
                              SEC sets the interval in seconds, and must be > 0.
      --short_stats         Disables the full gpu state output in each hashrate output, like it was before 0.7.10.
      --dev_location=LOC    Selects a specific location for the dev fee connection. Only use this if you see
                              continuous dev fee connection issues reported by the miner. The connection
                              management normally works well in all locations. Available options are:
                              world     - Anywhere in the world except for mainland China.
                              cn        - Mainland China.
                              non-gcp   - Countries with blocked access to Google Services (e.g. Iran, Cuba).
      --enable_compute      (Windows only) Enables compute mode and disables crossfire on necessary gpus.
      --long_timestamps     Enables microsec timestamps in the logs instead of seconds only.
      --restart_gpus        (Windows only) Restarts all configured gpus before mining, i.e. disable+enable PCI device.
      --uac                 (Windows only) Enable privilege escalation when the miner runs tasks like restarting gpus.
                              You can always avoid this by running the miner directly as Administrator.  This will
                              trigger the standard Windows escalation prompt, so you have to be available to click 'Yes'.
                              If this is not enabled, tasks that require Administrator privileges will fail when the
                              miner is running under a basic user account.

Pool config options:
  -o, --url=URL             Sets the pool URL.  Currently stratum+tcp and stratum+ssl URLs are supported.
                              Each additional time this option is specified will start a new pool config.
                              Per-pool options (such as -u, -p) will need to be explicitly specified
                              again for each new pool.  (See the example start_multipool.sh/bat file)
                              The multi-pool strategy for the miner is set with the --pool_strategy option.
  -u, --user=USERNAME       Sets the username for pool authorization.
  -p, --pass=PASSWORD       Sets the password for pool authorization.
      --pool_force_ensub    Forces an extranonce subscribe request for supported pools unknown to the miner.
      --pool_no_ensub       Prevent miner from sending extranonce subscribe request to the pool.
      --pool_broken_rpc     Tells the miner to only allow a single outstanding rpc request on the pool
                              connection.  This is a work-around for pools that violate the json rpc
                              specification regarding rpc IDs.
      --pool_debug          Logs all pool traffic.

Global pool options:
      --pool_connect_TO=SEC Set the time-out for attempting to connect to a pool. SEC is the time to wait in
                              seconds. Default is 10.
      --pool_rpc_TO=SEC     Set how long the miner will wait for an unanswered RPC to the pool.  After this
                              time, the miner will reconnect to the pool.  SEC is the time to wait in seconds.
                              Default is 60.
      --pool_max_rejects=N  If a pool rejects N shares in a row, the pool connection is reset. This is to prevent
                              against pools that invalidates mining sessions without disconnecting the user.
                              Default value is 5.
      --pool_strategy=STRAT Sets the strategy for selecting pools when running with multiple pools.  The available
                              values are: priority, load_balance, and quota.  The default is priority. 
                              priority: The miner will use pools in the order they are listed, only moving on 
                                to the next pool if the previous cannot establish a connection. 
                              load_balance: The miner will evenly balance the hashrate across all currently
                                connected pools.
                              quota: The miner will evenly balance the total hashes completed across 
                                all pools.  If a pool disconnects and later reconnects, the miner will move 
                                hashrate to the pool until the total hashes for each pool is balanced. 
      --no_ntime_roll       Prevents the miner from rolling ntime in the block header, only using the value
                              provided by the pool. This needs to be enabled for some pools when mining x16rt.

GPU options:
      --platform=INDEX      Sets the index of the OpenCL platform to use. If not specified, platform will
                              be auto-detected. Linux with multiple platforms is only supported using no
                              --platform arg but instead adding --bus_reorder.
  -d, --devices=DEVLIST     Sets gpu devices to use from detected list. DEVLIST should be a comma-
                              separated list of device indices, e.g. -d 0,1,2,4.  If not specified, all
                              devices on the platform(s) will be used.  NOTE: by default the devices are ordered
                              by pcie bus ordering. Use --list_devices to show indices.
      --init_style=1/2/3    Specified the init style (1 is default):
                              1: One gpu at the time, complete all before mining.
                              2: Three gpus at the time, complete all before mining.
                              3: All gpus in parallel, start mining immediately.
      --pcie_fmt=FORMAT     Sets print format for pcie bus numbers.  The accepted values for FORMAT are
                              either 'hex' or 'dec'.  The default is dec for windows and hex for linux.
      --bus_reorder         Reorders the detected or specified devices after their pcie bus id.  If no
                              platform is specified, devices will be collected from all detected AMD OpenCL
                              platforms.  Note: As of version v0.7.0 this is the default behavior.
      --opencl_order        Orders the detected or specified devices in the order OpenCL presents them.
      --list_devices        Lists the available devices for the detected or specified platform and exits
                              immediately.  Bus reordering will be implemented in the displayed order.

Watchdog options:
      --no_gpu_monitor      Disables the ADL (Windows) or sysfs (Linux) GPU monitor for temperature and
                              fan speed.
      --temp_limit=TEMP     Sets the temperature at which the miner will stop GPUs that are too hot.
                              Default is 85C.
      --temp_resume=TEMP    Sets the temperature below which the miner will resume GPUs that were previously
                              stopped due to temperature exceeding limit.  Default is 60C.
      --watchdog_script(=X) Configures the gpu watchdog to shut down the miner and run the specified platform
                              and exits immediately. The default script is watchdog.bat/watchdog.sh in the
                              current directory, but a different script can be provided as an optional argument,
                              potentially with a absolute or relative path as well.
      --watchdog_test       Tests the configured watchdog script by triggering the same action as a dead gpu
                              after ~20 secs of mining.
      --watchdog_disabled   Forces the watchdog to not execute. Can be used to disable the watchdog in mining os
                              that always run with the watchdog enabled.

Ethash options:
      --eth_config=CONFIG   Manual ethash configuration for the miner.  CONFIG must be in the form [M][L].
                              The [M] value selects the mode which can be either 'A' or 'B'.
                              The 'B' mode uses additional memory and will only work on 8+GB cards.
                              The [L] value selects the intensity and it's range will depend on the GPU architecture.
                              Both values are optional, but if [L] is specified, [M] must also be specified.
                              Example configs: --eth_config=A
                                               --eth_config=B750
                              CONFIG can also be a comma separated list of config values where each is
                              applied to each GPU. For example: --eth_config=A,B750,,A288
                              Any gpu that does not have a specific config in the list will use the first
                              config in the list.
      --eth_aggr_mode       Enables automatic use of the 'B' mode for all Polaris 8GB cards, unless they have a
                              different config provided by the --eth_config argument.  This is the same thing as 
                              manually setting all Polaris 8GB gpus in the rig to 'B' mode using --eth_config.
                              For most gpus, this adds 0.1-0.2 MH/s of hashrate.  NOTE: 20-25% of rigs becomes less
                              stable in this mode which is the reason it isn't the default mode.  If you experience
                              dead gpus, you should remove this argument and run the gpus in the 'A' mode.  Moreover,
                              this option will stop working when the DAG approaches 4GB. 
      --eth_stratum_mode=MODE Sets a fixed stratum mode for ethash pools.  By default the miner will attempt
                              to automatically determine the type of stratum the pool supports and use that mode.
                              This automatic detection can be overriden by specifying this option.  The MODE can be
                              set to one of the following options: stratum, nicehash, ethproxy. 
      --eth_worker          Set the worker id that will be sent to pool.  This only applies to pools with ethproxy
                              stratum mode.
      --eth_epoch           Tests a specific ethash epoch. NOTE: you still need to provide a pool as if you were mining,
                              but no shares will be submitted. Simulated mining only.
      --eth_alloc_epoch=N   Allocates enough memory for the given epoch from the start.  The miner will try to allocate more
                              if it needs to later during mining.  It's recommended for rigs with one or more 4GB cards to test
                              and set this to the max possible value to avoid reallocations at epoch switches.  Optimal Linux
                              rigs should be able to handle epoch 380, Windows rigs a little less (373-374).
      --eth_4g_alloc_adjust=X,Y,...  On Windows, the allocation balance is very delicate for 4GB gpus being able to reach their
                              maximum possible DAG epoch.  The miner uses a strategy that has worked fine for our test gpus,
                              but other setups can benefit from tweaking this number.  The valid range is [-128,+128].  Zero means
                              no adjustment.  You provide either a single value that is used for all 4GB gpus in the rig, or a
                              comma-separated list with values for all gpus, including non-4GB Polaris gpus.  Values for non-4GB
                              gpus are ignored.
      --eth_4g_max_alloc=X,Y,...  This argument allows mining on 4GB gpus after they no longer can store the full DAG in vram.
                              You pass either the max epoch to allocate memory for, or the raw nr of MB to allocate.  You can
                              provide a single value that applies to all 4GB gpus in the rig, or use a comma-separated list for
                              specifying different values per gpu.  Values for non-4GB gpus are ignored.
      --eth_dag_slowdown=N  Slows down the DAG generation.  Pass a single digit 0-9. 0 means no slowdown (<= 0.7.9 behavior),
                              1 means minimal slowdown, 9 means max.  Default value: 4 for a slight slowdown.
      --eth_no_stagger      Disables the staggering of gpus when building a new DAG.  The default behavior is to stagger
                              GPUs so they don't all enter the DAG build process at exactly the same time.
      --eth_no_ramp_up      Disables the ramping up of intensity for each gpu.
      --eth_direct_abort    Uses a different mechanism to abort ongoing gpu jobs.  Recommended for Vegas in ROCm environments
                              to minimize stale shares.  Will apply to Vega and Polaris gpus in the rig only. 
      --eth_dag_alloc_patch Some motherboards with outdated bios can see hw errs typically on the first or last gpu in the system.
                              Use this argument to force a patched dag allocation strategy that most often solves the issue.
                              Upgrading your bios often solves the issue as well.
      --eth_hashwatch(=M,M) Defines a min/max watchdog hashrate in MH/s expected when gpus are hashing.  If a GPU falls outside
                              of this range for too long it will be considered faulty and the watchdog will be triggered.  The
                              default min/max values are 2 MH/s and 150 MH/s.  To activate with default values, use
                              --eth_hashwatch.  To set your own values, use e.g. --eth_hashwatch=1.25,60.  The same range is used
                              for all gpus in the rig.  A negative value for one side disables it, e.g. use --eth_hashwatch=-1,1000
                              to handle gpu resets that result in huge fake hashrates but no minimum check.

Progpow options:
      --prog_config=CONFIG  Manual progpow configuration for the miner.  CONFIG must be in the form [M][L].
                              The [M] value selects the mode which can be either 'A' or 'B'.
                              The 'B' mode typically results in better performance but is only available for
                              Vega on linux and Navi (linux or windows).
                              The [L] value selects the intensity and it's range will depend on the GPU architecture.
                              Both values are optional, but if [L] is specified, [M] must also be specified.
                              Example configs: --prog_config=A
                                               --prog_config=B750
                              CONFIG can also be a comma separated list of config values where each is
                              applied to each GPU. For example: --prog_config=A,B750,,A288
                              Any gpu that does not have a specific config in the list will use the first.
      --prog_height=VALUE   Sets a fixed block height for progpow algorithms for benchmarking purposes.
                              Note that using this option needs a pool connection but will not submit shares.
      --prog_strict         Forces miner to always generate strictly accurate kernels.  By default the miner will
                              generate relaxed kernels that use less computation power but can result in 
                              occasional invalid shares.
      --prog_dag_slowdown=N  Slows down the DAG generation.  Pass a single digit 0-9.  0 means no slowdown (<= 0.7.9 behavior),
                              1 means minimal slowdown, 9 means max.  Default value: 4 for a slight slowdown.
      --prog_no_stagger      Disables the staggering of gpus when building a new DAG.  The default behavior is to stagger
                              GPUs so they don't all enter the DAG build process at exactly the same time.
      --prog_no_ramp_up      Disables the ramping up of intensity for each gpu.

Cryptonight options:
      --rig_id              Set the rig identifier that will be sent to the pool. This is only used for
                              cryptonight pools.
      --cn_config=CONFIG    Manual cryptonight configuration for the miner.  CONFIG must be in the form
                              [P][I0][M][I1][:xyz], where [P] is an optional prefix and [:xyz] is an
                              optional suffix.  For [P], only the value of 'L' is supported for low-end
                              GPUs like Lexa/Baffin.  [I0] and [I1] are the thread intensity values normally
                              ranging from 1 to 16, but larger values are possible for 16GB gpus.  [M] is the
                              mode which can be either '.', -', '+' or '*'.  Mode '.' means that the miner
                              should choose or scan for the best mode.  Mode '*' both a good default more and
                              _should_ be used if you mine on a Vega 56/64 with modded mem timings.  The
                              exceptions to this rule are small pad variants (cnv8_trtl and cnv8_upx2), they
                              should still use '+'. For Polaris gpus, only the '-' and '+' modes are available.
                              
                              NOTE: in TRM 0.5.0 auto-tuning functionality was added, making manual configuration
                              of the CN config modes unnecessary except for rare corner cases.  For more info, 
                              see the tuning docs and how-to documents bundled with the release. 
                              
                              Example configs: --cn_config=15*15:AAA
                                               --cn_config=14-14
                                               --cn_config=L4+3
                              CONFIG can also be a comma separated list of config values where each is
                              applied to each GPU. For example: --cn_config=8-8,16+14:CBB,15*15,14-14
                              Any gpu that does not have a specific config in the list will use the first
                              config in the list.
      --no_cpu_check        Disables cpu verification of found shares before they are submitted to the pool.
                              Note: only CN algos currently supports cpu verification.
      --no_lean             Disables the CN lean mode where ramp up threads slowly on start or restart after
                              network issues or gpu temp throttling. 
      --no_interleave=DEVS  Lists gpu devices where CN thread interleave logic should be not be used. 
                              The argument is a comma-separated list of devices like for the -d option. 
                              Use this argument if some device(s) get a worse hashrate together with a lot
                              of interleave adjust log messages. 
      --alloc_patch=DEVS    Lists gpu devices that loses hashrate between TRM v0.4.5 and later versions. With this 
                              argument a simpler mem allocation strategy is used, and the old (higher) hashrate should
                              be restored. Auto-tuning mode can still be used.
      --auto_tune=MODE      Enable the auto-tune mode upon startup. Only available for CN variants. MODE must 
                              be either NONE, QUICK or SCAN. The QUICK mode checks a few known good configurations
                              and completes within 1 min. The SCAN mode will check all possible combos and will
                              run for 20-30 mins. Setting MODE to NONE disable the auto-tune feature. The default
                              mode is QUICK. 
      --auto_tune_runs(=N)  Executes multiple runs for the auto tune, each time decreasing the unit of pads used -1
                              in one of the threads (15+15 -> 15+14 -> 14+14 -> 14+13 -> ...). You can specify the
                              explicit nr of runs or let the miner choose a default value per gpu type (typically 3-4).
      --auto_tune_exit      If present, the miner will exit after completing the auto-tuning process. This is helpful
                              when you want to scan for optimal settings and then use the resulting command line arg
                              printed by the miner.
      --allow_large_alloc   If present, and when the driver indicates there is enough GPU vram available, the miner
                              will be more aggressive with the initial memory allocation. In practice, this option
                              means that Vega GPUs under Linux will start the auto-tuning process at 16*15 rather
                              than 16*14 or 15*15.

MTP options:
      --allow_all_devices   Some algos can't be mined on e.g. 4GB gpus. Those gpus will be disabled automatically
                              by the miner. This argument overrides this logic and allows mining on all specified
                              or detected devices.

X16* options:
      --hash_order=VALUE    Sets a fixed hash order for algorithms like x16r for benchmarking purposes.
                              Note that using this option needs a pool connection but will not submit shares.
                              The standard benchmark hash order for x16r is --hash_order=0123456789abcdef.
Nimiq options:
      --nimiq_worker=VALUE  Sets the worker/device name for nimiq to pass to the pool(s).
      --nimiq_no_proxy      Disables the automatic Nimiq proxy executed as a separate process. This means that the
                              host and port passed to the miner must be pointing to a proxy.
      --nimiq_proxy=VALUE   Overrides the default path to the Nimiq proxy. The default is trm_nimiq_proxy-win.exe.
                              and trm_nimiq_proxy-linux in the current miner director.
      --nimiq_port=VALUE    Overrides the default local port (4444) used for the Nimiq proxy. This can be used if your
                              system is already using port 4444 for some other tcp/ip service.
