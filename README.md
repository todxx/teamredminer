### v0.8.6.3
#### Changes
- Autolykos2: emergency release to support larger pad size from block 614400.  Some GPUs (mainly Vegas) will need higher core clocks to achieve the same performance as previous versions due to larger pads breaking some previous optimizations.  More optimizations to come in future releases.
- Autolykos2: added argument --autolykos_ignore_diff for certain pools that aren't compatible with the ERGO reference miner pool implementation.
- Progpow: fixed wrong --help text for --prog_micro_tune.

### v0.8.6.2

- General: added Autolykos2 algo for ERGO (very good target for Vega 56/64, see the AUTOLYKOS_TUNING.txt guide).
- General: improved and simplified dual ZIL mining for ethash/kawpow/verthash/autolykos2 (see the new DUAL_ZIL_MINING.txt guide).

### v0.8.2.1
#### Changes
- Bugfix: fixed windows issue with intermittently reading zero gpu stats and blasting fans (bug in 0.8.2).
- Verthash: added --verthash_max_uploads=N to control the upload of the verthash table to gpus at startup. Some chipsets get issues running > 4 gpus concurrently. Typical error is that multiple gpus die immediately at startup when running the full rig, but work fine if you only run 3-4 gpus.
- Verthash: fixed support for 550 2GB gpus. 

### v0.8.2

#### Changes
- General: added Verthash algo for Vertcoin.
- General: added Tonga and Antigua support for ethash and kawpow.

           See the ETHASH_TUNING_GUIDE.txt for a short section on Big Navis. 
           Driver support missing on Windows for fan control and mem temp.
- Ethash: display gpus now use A-mode by default to prevent failed allocation and low hashrates.
- Stats: handling of negative temperatures under Linux.
- Eth+zil: added new pool strategy 'min_epoch' for dual pool connection switching (see start_zil_eth.bat/.sh example script).

### v0.8.0
#### Notes
Biggest release in a long while with rewritten ethash kernels and new mining modes for all gpu types!

Users are highly(!) recommended to take a few minutes to read the 0.7-to-0.8 [migration guide](https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/blob/master/doc/ETHASH_FROM_0.7_TO_0.8.txt) and the new [ethash tuning guide](https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/blob/master/doc/ETHASH_TUNING_GUIDE.txt). Key highlights:

- Polaris: Efficiency and slight hashrate increase. B-mode reintroduced for added hash. B-mode must be enabled with --eth_aggr_mode or --eth_config=Bxxx.
- Vega 56/64: greatly improved base kernel for efficiency. New B-mode that can shave off additional 1-2W on top of the A-mode kernel. B-mode must be enabled manually with --eth_config (--eth_aggr_mode does not apply). Tuning numbers have changed - do NOT keep your old static --eth_config values.
- Radeon VII: huge boost with its new C-mode but requires a special Linux setup. Can now do 100 MH/s on most air cooled VIIs. See tuning guide.
- 5700/5700XT: can shave off as much as 8-9W(!) of power using the new B-mode and dropping core clk+voltage. B-mode now the default mining mode. Unless you retune your core clk+voltage you will see a tiny power draw increase instead and not benefit from the upgrade, so read the migration guide. 
- 5600XT: new B-mode has a much smaller effect. A-mode remains the default mining mode. See new tuning guide for more details.
- The dag cache is NOT compatible with the new B/C-modes. ETH+ZIL switchers have to choose between caching the epoch 0 dag and using the new mining modes.
- Ethash 4GB kernels NOT rewritten in this release, performance remains the same as in 0.7.x.
- See the migration guide for hashrate and power draw comparisons between 0.7.21 and 0.8.0.

#### Changes
- Ethash: VII kernel rewrite and new C-mode with boost feature (see guide).
- Ethash: Navi kernel slight optimization and new B-mode for lower core clock and power.
- Ethash: Vega kernel rewrite and new B-mode for lower core clock and power.
- Ethash: Polaris kernel rewrite and new B-mode for slightly higher perf.
- Ethash: added share processing timeout and default for Binance pool (see --pool_share_limit_ms).
- Claymore API: fixed leak that stopped serving requests after 32k api calls.
- Claymore API: added password support (see --cm_api_password).
- Logging: added log rotation support (see --log_rotate).
- Logging: log files now contain the miner welcome message so the version is stored.
- Kawpow: now mining ok at MiningPoolHub even though their seedhash is broken.
- Fan control: added min/max fan speed range (see --fan_control).
- General: added argument to turn off duplicate pci bus id filtering (see --allow_dup_bus_ids).

### v0.7.22
#### Notes
1) NAVI KERNEL REWRITE! Over the last month we've been working on new kernels. The first one released is for Navi. The main feature is lower power consumption, hashrate will remain about the same but depends somewhat on clocks. NOTE: please let the miner retune any existing --eth_config arguments for all Navi gpus, the new values will be significantly lower.
2) Claymore API now supported, meaning you can use EthMan to monitor TRM rigs. 

#### Changes
- Ethash: Kernel rewrite for Navi.  Should now be more stable and use less power.  Vega/Polaris still in the works.
- General: Slightly reworked init procedure again to address some rigs running better on <= 0.7.18 than >= 0.7.19.
- General: Added Claymore compatible API, see the --cm_api_listen option.

### v0.7.21
#### Notes
Quick release that addresses situations where Ethash with capped DAG on 4GBs would crash after 5-10 mins when running at 4078-4080MB.

#### Changes
- Ethash: improved probability for high (4078-4080MB) ethash 4GB capped allocation running stable over time.

### v0.7.20
#### Notes
ETH is now approaching the start of the 4GB death with the upcoming switch to epoch 382. TRM was the first miner to add support for mining with 4GB gpus with a partial DAG, here called "extended mining". However, it has always required manual configuration. This release adds a default conservative cap at 4072MB for DAG storage on 4GB gpus for out-of-the-box execution of the miner. For maximum performance, miners are still advised to manually tune their rig(s) with the --eth_4g_max_alloc argument. Most rigs runs stable with a higher value than 4072, which makes a significant difference for upcoming ETH epochs. 

For more detailed instructions, our Ethash 4GB guide has also been updated and is available at https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/blob/master/doc/ETHASH_4GB_HOWTO.txt

#### Changes
- Ethash: added default capped DAG allocation for 4GBs at 4072MB (see --eth_4g_max_alloc).
- Ethash: bugfix for crashes using --eth_dag_cache on 4GB gpus.

### v0.7.19
#### Notes
1) Ethash solo-miner share high-score list added, use --high_score to enable.
2) Ethash single buffer dag for a small power save. Only available on recent drivers and should in theory always be an improvement. It is not verified 100% stable yet and therefore not the default in this version. Enable with --eth_dag_buf=A to test.
3) Miner gpu initialization procedure rewritten. The init procedure should now hopefully be much more stable, especially on Navis in general and even more so for 5600(XT)s.

#### Changes
- General: added adjustable ratio support for quota and load_balance pool strategies (see --pool_ratio).
- General: rewrote the miner init procedure to be more stable in general.
- General: fixed issue where output blocking could cause mining work to stop.
- General: reduced main binary size.
- Ethash: reintroduced single DAG buffer support for recent drivers allowing large single allocations (see --eth_dag_buf).
- Ethash: added high score list of the 15 highest value shares found since start (see --high_score).
- Ethash: small improvements in keeping the gpu busy over epoch switches. 
- Ethash: fixed bug that would cause deadlocks in rare occasions.
- Ethash: bugfix - dag cache wasn't enabled for 4GB gpus.

### v0.7.18
#### Notes
1) Support for the ETC fork added. Run with "-a etchash" for easiest support, see "--eth_variant_mode" in the help for more info.
2) ETH+ZIL miners: add "--eth_dag_cache=0" to use a second dag cache and prebuild epoch 0 immediately at miner start.
3) Ethash miners relying on ramp-up and stagger for stability: the default mode of these tweaks has been changed to off. They now need to be enabled with --eth_ramp_up and --eth_stagger. While helping a number of rigs, these tweaks caused increased instability of others, making the choice of a good default mode difficult.

#### Changes
- Added etchash support (see algo etchash and --eth_variant_mode).
- Added dag cache support, mostly intended for eth+zil mining (see --eth_dag_cache).
- Fixed hex char parsing in enable/disable submenu, can now work with >= 10 gpus.
- Changed the default for ethash ramp-up and staggering to false (see --eth_ramp_up and --eth_stagger).
- Added check for broken win setups with duplicated opencl platforms and/or devices.

### v0.7.17
#### Changes
- BETA: Added fan control, see --help section or USAGE.txt. Enable with --fan_control.
- Fixed deadlock bug that could happen when using multiple pools with the failover strategy.
- Added option for not sending stale shares (see --no_stale_submit).
- Added watchdog check for early gpu init hangs.
- Added example watchdog scripts for win/linux.

### v0.7.16
#### Notes
BETA RELEASE - small fixes for Turtlecoin's new algo chukwa2.

#### Changes
- Chukwa2: fixed kernels loading for Radeon VII gpus.
- Chukwa2: fixed mem footprint for 2GB gpus.

### v0.7.16b
#### Notes
BETA RELEASE - adds Turtlecoin's new algo chukwa2. Not tested as rigorously as other versions. Only use for the Turtlecoin fork.
NOTE: Navi gpus are NOT supported on chukwa2 for now. Support will be added if there's sufficient interest.

#### Changes
- Added algo trtl_chukwa2 for the Turtlecoin fork on 2020-10-22.

### v0.7.15

#### Notes
Small bugfix release.

#### Changes
- Ethash: fixed bug for ZIL (epoch 0) mining on 4GB gpus (bug appeared in 0.7.14).
- Ethash: reverted to v0.7.10 kernels for stability purposes except for ROCm-based rigs.

### v0.7.14
#### Notes
This release wraps up our work for 4GB gpus mining ethash. Linux 4GB are verified to mine up to and including epoch 381 on drivers 18.50/19.30/19.50/20.10. After that, we have added support for extended mining from epoch 382 and up. Extended mining is a trade-off between hashrate and being able to mine at all, gpus will lose additional hashrate for every extra epoch. Please see the Linux section in the ETHASH_4GB_HOWTO.txt for more details and instructions.

#### Changes
- Ethash: verified Linux support for 4GB gpus up to and including epoch 381.
- Ethash: added support for extended 4GB mining from epoch 382 and up.
- Kawpow: cleaned up false hw errs for some block heights.

### v0.7.13
#### Notes
1) Windows user with 4GB rigs - see the new guide ETHASH_4GB_HOWTO.txt for instructions.

#### Changes
- Added better default Windows dag allocation strategy on 4GB gpus.
- Added experimental support for resetting gpus before mining (Windows only).
- Added argument for manual adjustment of 4GB dag allocation (see --eth_4g_alloc_adjust=X,Y,Z,...).
- Added protection against broken dev servers with additional random server selection mechanism.

### v0.7.12
#### Notes
1) Bugfix release: v0.7.11 could crash with rejected ethash shares.

#### Changes
- Fixed print format bug on ethash rejected shares.

### v0.7.11
#### Notes
1) Ethash additions: printing share diff in GH (always enabled), hashrate watchdog (see --eth_hashwatch).
2) Better debug support: --long_timestamps, --pool_debug.
3) We've found certain motherboard/bios combinations that due to kernel and/or driver bugs have issues with the first or last gpu in rigs. If you see excessive hw errors reported on a single gpu, and switching around gpus still always generates errors in the first or last gpu, try using --eth_dag_alloc_patch.

#### Changes
- Added DAG allocation patch under linux for certain mobo/bios combinations (see --eth_dag_alloc_patch).
- Added ethash hashrate watchdog (see --eth_hashwatch).
- Added ethash abort mechanism for Vegas on ROCm (see --eth_direct_abort). Not useful in other contexts.
- Added pool traffic debug (use --pool_debug).
- Added print of share difficulty for ethash family algos. Unit is always GH.
- Added microsec timestamp resolution in logs (use --long_timestamps).
- Regression bug: argon2/chukwa was broken in 0.7.10, now working again.
- Turned off compute mode checks for non-Polaris gpus.

### v0.7.10
#### Notes
1) Ethash 4GB rigs, especially on win, _should_ use --eth_alloc_epoch=N with N being the max epoch that the gpus can allocate. This will avoid DAG reallocation issues.
2) For Navi rigs having issues with eth+zil or Nicehash mining with frequent DAG switching, try using --eth_dag_slowdown=9.

#### Changes
- Added default log filename (trm_<algo>_<yyyymmdd_hhmmss>.log)
- Added ethash forced initial allocated epoch ( --eth_alloc_epoch=N). Note: HIGHLY recommended for 4GB rigs.
- Added ethash family DAG build slowdown configuration (--eth_dag_slowdown=N, default value 4).
- Added ethash family DAG build staggering across gpus (disable with --eth_no_stagger).
- Added ethash family intensity ramp-up (disable with --eth_no_ramp_up).
- Added option for forcing dev fee region (see --dev_location).
- Added MTP for Navi gpus.
- Added MTP ramp-up after pad rebuild.
- Fixed error printouts on failed watchdog script execution on Linux.
- Stats: now shows more clocks and temps, and also adds gpu state in hashrate prints (see --short_stats to disable).
- Added checks for and enabling compute mode and disabling crossfire on Windows (see --enable_compute).

### v0.7.9
#### Changes
- Fixes for mixed rig mining on Linux.
- Added --eth_epoch argument for easier epoch testing.
- Added --eth_aggr_mode for automatic aggressive 'B' mode on Polaris 8GB gpus.
- Added --watchdog_disable argument.

### v0.7.8
#### Changes
- Upgrade for the upcoming Haven hard fork (July 20, 2020).
- Tiny Nimiq optimizations (1-2% max, mostly Vega and Navi).
- Fixed CPU usage issue when redirecting stdin to /dev/null.
- Fixed pool name returned by API for Nimiq.

### v0.7.7
#### Changes
- Added support for Nimiq Polaris/Vega (dumb mode only).
- Integrated a Nimiq node.js network proxy into the miner.
- Fixed Nimiq bug that could lose shares, especially against lower vardiff pools.
- Fixed Nimiq bug that could cause duplicate shares on startup for low-diff pools.
- Fixed regression bug for ethash Nicehash, correct stratum mode now used again.
- Added support for Nimiq Navi.
- Added support for icemining Nimiq solo mining mode (set -p m=solo).

### v0.7.6
#### Changes
- Fixed broken keyboard input in tmux+screen sessions (e.g. Hive OS).
- Added support for 5500(xt).
- Fixed Linux watchdog support for hard driver crashes (script was not executed).
- Fixed kawpow nicehash extranonce support.

### v0.7.5
#### Changes
- Fixed broken optimizations for kawpow in 0.7.4.

### v0.7.4
#### Changes
- Increased ethash support on 4GB GPUs up to epoch 380-383
- Implemented split ethash dag buffers for 8GB GPUs to support DAGs over 4GB
- Kawpow optimizations (Navi +2.25%, Vega +1.25%, Polaris +0.25%)
- Added gpu enable/disable API support.
- Windows TDR detection/handling/warning.
- Monitor detection on Windows/Linux with intensity adjustment.
- Fix for ethash pool hashrate reporting stopping after network outage.

### v0.7.3
#### Changes
- Emergency patch for 4GB cards to handle a few more ETC epochs.
  A more complete patch is coming out shortly.

### v0.7.2
#### Changes
- Fixed kawpow dag build DEAD gpu issue on windows Adrenalin 2020 drivers.
- Fixed Navi 5600(xt) support on windows.
